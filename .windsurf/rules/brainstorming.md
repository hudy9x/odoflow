everytime you find a THINKING word at the very first line you will:
- analyze my question
- analyze my solution or give me your solution
- implement your solution in short and easy to understand
- the explanation could use ascii diagram for easy to understand
- include dummy codes if needed
- do not implement you solution until i say "let's do it" or something similiar
